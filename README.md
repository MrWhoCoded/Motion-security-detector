# Motion-security-detector

This is a basic homemade replica of the sucurity systems that are used at various places. The repository includes 2 files the [motion_sensor.py](motion_sensor.py)
and the [time_stamps.txt](time_stamps.txt). the .py file is supposed to be ran on a micro controller (in my case I have used Rpi 3b+). Once motion is detected, Led will glow,
Pi will outpt the video in .h264 format and write the time of the motion detection to the time_stamps.txt
